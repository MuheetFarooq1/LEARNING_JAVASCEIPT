// treat all js code as never version 

//alert(3+3) tis alert will work on the browser as we are using node js and it is the formate of the browser 

console.log(30+30); console.log(" muheet") // this is not the goood practice we have to maintaine code readablity 

// the code readibility should be high 

//  the original documentation of the javascript is ecma  script and it is all about standardses and they have there own priorties algorithm 

// data type 

let name= "muheet" //string 
let age=22 //number
let isloggedin= false // booolean 

// we have datatype as
// number =>willl have the number value and it has arange of 2 to power of 53
// to store big integer we use=> big int
// //string=> and we should use doublequotes as the best practice 
//boolean=> it will give  us the value in true and false 
//null =>its imp in javascript as it is a stand alone value  and we can assign it also 
// when we cheack the type of null it gives us the object 
//undefined => it has a value but its not defined yet 
//symbol=> its used as a unique feature and mostly used in node js
//type of=> will tell us what type of data it is
